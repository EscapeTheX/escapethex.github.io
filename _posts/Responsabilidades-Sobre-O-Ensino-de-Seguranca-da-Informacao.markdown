People interested in so-called ethical hacking are already interested in doing dishonest, illegal, and unethical things, otherwise they’d choose a legitimate IT specialty—so it's hard to prevent them from following their natural tendencies over time.
Ethical hacking is essentially a smokescreen for people who want to do unethical things and then claim that they had the best of intentions when they are called out on it.

You can't learn professional-level security from wannabe hackers. A well-qualified teacher is an absolute necessity. The fact that many people aren't aware of the teaching materials and certifications required to be an industry level hacker is being exploited by cheap teachers.

PROBLEMA

O impacto da tecnologia traz sérios comprometimentos com o desenvolvimento neuropsicológico da pessoa. Os pais relaxam nas restrições sobre o tempo da criança exposta a tecnologia. As tecnologias vem como mecanismo de recompensa, substituindo regulação emocional, o que é prejudicial para o desenvolvimento físico e emocional. Na adolescência costuma surgir varáveis negativas como ADHD, sentimento de solidão, notas baixas, mutitarefas não é algo que o seu cérebro pode fazer entquanto está se aprendendo algo.

Use a tecnologia para melhorar e aumentar a sua interação social; para se ter acesso a um ambiente de aprendizado; 

“The vast majority of people on YouTube are trying to make videos that totally abide by the community guidelines and laws,” said Ruane.
“My preferred solution would be if there was some kind of facility of verifying so that I could say look this is what I do, I’m a professional.”
“I feel as though censorship of this type of content is harmful to the community as a whole,” he said, admitting that people who aren’t aware of ethical hacking often ask if he can be hired to spy on their partners.
“I think a lot of [the] time it takes someone to say that you shouldn’t be doing that, and if there’s no mentor in their lives, then they’re obviously not going to receive that information and be more likely to turn to black hat websites to obtain information, and get sucked into illegal activities.”
“I hold essentially the same view for all videos on YouTube,” said Ruane. “When it comes to tutorials, and the kind of area that I sit in, where it’s educational videos or how-to videos, all I’m teaching people is how to use the tool.
Now with the front-page headlines increasingly dedicated to threats of cyberwarfare, and government attempts to get rid of end-to-end encryption for messaging apps, it should come as no surprise that hackers have found themselves in the same boat as responsible gun owners.
This included videos showing how to manufacture, modify, and sell guns or gun-related accessories, notably in regards to the customization of an automatic pistol. The move was taken in line with the mass shooting that had occurred in Parkland, Florida just over a month before – a tragedy that took the lives of 17 people
“I wouldn’t feel guilty if somebody did something bad with this knowledge because I’ve said in my disclaimers that the information should be used to prevent such an attack,” said Abou-Chabke. “I’m not in any way promoting it [criminal behaviour].”
“If I am demonstrating a zero-day attack on Google or Yahoo or a public IP, that’s probably not a good idea because you need written permission from the owner in order to hack them for the purpose of finding vulnerabilities,” he said.
“Black hat is not criminal – it’s actually one of the elite hackers, which separates them from the kids. A criminal is a criminal no matter what they do.”
